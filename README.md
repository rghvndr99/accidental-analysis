1. **setting package.json**  
   It is used for including the list of dependencies to install from npm.  
   Following commands are used for package.json:  
   **npm init:**  it makes package.json file in your project.  
    **npm install 'any library/module' --dev  -save :** this will save library into package.json as dev-dependency. If '--dev' is not given,then it will be saved as dependency, not as dev-dependency.  
 
  For its structure, see the attached screenshot:
